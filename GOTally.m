% At its highest level, this script first finds which GO IDs occur--since
% there is a theoretical max of 9,999,999 unique GO ID's, it is efficient
% to only find those which occur.  Next, this script assigns a unique numerical
% value to each GO ID, e.g. 1 == GO ID 15.  Lastly, this script finds
% tallies the normalized amount of GO IDs for each GO ID for each sample
% and saves this data to file.  The final output is a 1 x 3013 x 3 x 3 x 5
% matrix, where 3013 corresponds to the number of GO IDs, and 3 3 5
% correspond to the number of samples.  Note that this essentially converts
% from the 876 non-decoy proteins to 3013 GO IDs.
