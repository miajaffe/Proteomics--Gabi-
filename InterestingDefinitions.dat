 The lipid bilayer surrounding a zymogen granule.

 A layer consisting mainly of proteins (especially collagen) and glycosaminoglycans (mostly as proteoglycans) that forms a sheet underlying or overlying cells such as endothelial and epithelial cells. The proteins are secreted by cells in the vicinity. An example of this component is found in Mus musculus.

 The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the exocrine pancreas over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The exocrine pancreas produces and store zymogens of digestive enzymes, such as chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen in the acinar cells.

 Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell differentiation, the process in which relatively unspecialized cells acquire specialized structural and functional features.

In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.

 The process in which relatively unspecialized cells, e.g. embryonic or regenerative cells, acquire specialized structural and/or functional features that characterize the cells, tissues, or organs of the mature organism or some other relatively stable phase of the organism's life history. Differentiation includes the processes involved in commitment of a cell to a specific fate and its subsequent development to the mature state.

 A semiautonomous, self replicating organelle that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration.

 Interacting selectively and non-covalently with ATP, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, a universally important coenzyme and enzyme regulator.

 The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes.

 Interacting selectively and non-covalently with zinc (Zn) ions.

 The region of the plasma membrane located at the apical end of the cell.

 Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.

 Interacting selectively and non-covalently with calcium ions (Ca2+).

 The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the digestive system over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The digestive system is the entire structure in which digestion takes place. Digestion is all of the physical, chemical, and biochemical processes carried out by multicellular organisms to break down ingested nutrients into components that may be easily absorbed and directed into metabolism.

 Morphogenesis of the pancreas. Morphogenesis is the process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized.
